					<h2>Karaage</h2>
					<br />
					<p>It is a Japanese cooking technique in which various foods most often chicken, 
					but also other meat and fish are deep fried in oil. The process involves lightly 
					coating small pieces of the meat or fish with flour, or potato or corn starch, and 
					frying in a light oil. The foods are marinated prior to coating. The process differs 
					from the preparation of tempura, which is not marinated and uses a batter for coating.
					Karaage is often served alone or with rice and shredded cabbage. It has become popular 
					to eat Karaage wrapped with green perilla leaves and lettuce leaves.</p>

					<h2>Peanuts butter</h2>
					<p>Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. 
					It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, 
					r emulsifiers. Peanut butter is popular in many countries. The United States is a leading exporter 
					of peanut butter and itself consumes $800 million of peanut butter annually. Peanut butter is served
					as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers, and used to make sandwiches. It is also used in a number of 
					breakfast dishes and desserts, such as peanut-flavored granola, smoothies, crepes, cookies, brownies, 
					or croissants. It is similar to other nut butters such as cashew butter and almond butter.</p>
